# Wave Power
Forcasting system of wave-power along  the Mediterranean Sea

Background:

ODYSSEA project will develop, operate and demonstrate an interoperable and cost-effective platform that
fully integrates networks of observing and forecasting systems across the Mediterranean basin,
addressing both the open sea and the coastal zone.
In this project, we foucs on one task of the ODYSSEA project - creating a forecasting system of wave-power along 
the Mediterranean Sea.
As part of this, we used several methods(Fourier Transform, trionm, intepolation, etc.).
In addition, we performed an in-depth analysis of results but you can see all of them only in the document.

The code is mostly created such that it can be usefull for other unrelated projects.
The files we have decided to upload are: 

Inerpolation.cpp\.h-include functions of Fourier Transform, Trionm, Intepolation.

ReadBMP.cpp\.h-include functions for read bmp files.

WriteBMP.cpp\.h-include functions for write bmp files.

Ncread.cpp\.h-include functions for read netcdf files.

These files used in other files and libraries to run the project.more details you can find in the project document or here:

If God wills,(we joked.h-it's healthy),in the future, we will uploaded the files that include functions that analysis the results.

Documnet:

We have added a document that describing the methods we used and proof of mathematical correctness,
data analysis results, and technical help to use files.
